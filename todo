Not working as expected:

[ ] (scrambling error msgs on simultaneous processes) yyy | xxx | echo ola!
[ ] (should split last pipe and execute ls) ""|"""ls""-la""|"|"ls"
[ ] (should execute cd and create file) cd $HOME > file
[ ] (should print error) unset -USER
[ ] (should only accept alphanumeric characters) unset USER-
[ ] (export should diplay d="" e="" f="", env is ok) export d= e= f=
[?] (blocking commands: cat, grep something, awk something -- error message) ctrl-\ : ^\Quit (core dumped)
