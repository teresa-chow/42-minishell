Not working as expected:
[ ] (problem with blocking external commmands) cat > file | echo "something"
[ ] cat << a < todo > file1

Fixed:
[x] (should split last pipe and execute ls) ""|"""ls""-la""|"|"ls"
[x] (should execute cd and create file) cd $HOME > file
[x] cat << a > file1 | cat << b > file2 (cat << a > file1 not redirecting input -- check pipe)

Not handling (personal choice)
[x] (bettered with buffer: scrambling error msgs on simultaneous processes) yyy | xxx | echo ola!
[?] (blocking commands: cat, grep something, awk something -- error message) ctrl-\ : ^\Quit (core dumped)
[x] (bash doesn't signal this error: should only accept alphanumeric characters) unset USER-
[x] (bash doesn't signal this error:should print error) unset -USER
